    <p>The below works are taken from my 2022 Master's thesis, <i>Humanizing Computational Literature Analysis Through Art-Based Visualizations</i>
      in which I completed a computational analysis of 15,000 fictional works taken from Project Gutenberg.
      The analysis was aimed at identifying how and how often males versus females are characterized.
      In an effort to humanize the results of what sometimes feel like a cold, analytical method of analysis,
      I chose to translate the findings into an art portfolio that includes computational art as well as
      pure studio art pieces. Not only do the works intend to bring the viewer closer to such impactful
      findings, but art-making process served as a therapeutic venture that allowed for me to fully unpack and understand the implications
      of the computational literary analysis.

    <h3>Shift</h3>
    <p>The <i>Shift</i> visualizations were named for there abilitiy to show the shifting of gender representation
    throughout a single book. They were created by dividing a book into three equal parts, meant to symbolically
    represent the three parts of the classical story arc. Sentences within each respective third
    that contained one or more of a predetermined gender-specific word were tagged as either female, male or both.
    In each row of the diagram 1,000 dots were generated. The percentage of gendered sentences that were labelled female
    determined the number of dots that were placed in the right rectangle. Conversely, the percentage of male sentences
    dictated the number of dots on the left.
