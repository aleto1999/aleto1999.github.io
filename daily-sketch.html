<p>The first I heard the word "flow" in reference to work, was not from a coder, but rather from an art teacher. The benefit of being a perfectionist (read: slow) in art class, was that I spent a lot of time after class in the art room absorbing conversations of the older kids with our teacher. She described flow in drawing as having pushed past the point of self-judgement. The only thing that exists in your mind is your subject and the need to put it on paper.</p>
<p>During that time, we were covering figure drawing in class. I began obsessively listening to the same set of songs, use the same pencil, pull my hair back in the same way each time I sat down to draw. Eventually I hit my stride and was able to dip in and out of flow. Since then, I’ve strived for my flow state whether I’m coding, reading or drawing. </p>
<p>This morning I opted for a figure drawing exercise and listened to a 7 year old playlist in an attempt to recapture that first feeling of flow. I will continue to work toward that utter lack of self-judgement. </p>

    <p>Above is a one-line drawing exercise depicting different items on my desk: the base of a lamp, a stack of books, and my sewing machine.</p>

    <p>Today I also put some more touches on a jellyfish drawing that I began over the summer. My goal was to emphasize the fishbowl, as round pieces of glass are extremely challenging to communicate well. It's a work in progress...</p>

    <p>This morning while on our weekly update call, I mentioned to Scott that I was planning to make a drawing of a jellyfish inside of a lava lamp rather than a fishbowl (above). This sparked Scott's imagination and he suggested that I create a lava lamp simulation to use as a form of data visualization. Inspired by this conversation, I created the below lava lamp simulation in Processing as my daily sketch. </p>
    <div class="centered" id="lavalamp1"></div>
    <p>The simulation is a prototype for something a bit more sophisticated. Currently, the sketch consists of 4 "leader" and 8 "follower" ellipses traveling through a vector field. The vector field is re-generated every so often so that the ellipses don't fall into a pattern. The "followers" also change leaders every so often to simulate the bits of lava that break off of larger pieces in an actual lava lamp. </p>
    <p>Some ideas for improving the sketch are to dive into the pixel-level to create more organic-looking shapes around the ellipses, while still using the ellipses as the drivers of movement. I also would consider transitioning into WebGL 3D to add lighting and the z-dimension. I could potentially capture the bottom-lighting and glow of a lava lamp.  </p>
    <p>If worked into a higher-quality version, the lava lamp could be used as a data visualization tool. Though I'm unsure of how I would make that happen yet, I'd love to explore the idea of a multi-colored lava lamp. Traditionally this effect is created by adding different colored lighting at the top and bottom of the lamp. However, because this is a simulation, it may be interesting to explore this theme without the inherent limitations of physical matter. </p>
