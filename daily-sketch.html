<p>The first I heard the word "flow" in reference to work, was not from a coder, but rather from an art teacher. The benefit of being a perfectionist (read: slow) in art class, was that I spent a lot of time after class in the art room absorbing conversations of the older kids with our teacher. She described flow in drawing as having pushed past the point of self-judgement. The only thing that exists in your mind is your subject and the need to put it on paper.</p>
<p>During that time, we were covering figure drawing in class. I began obsessively listening to the same set of songs, use the same pencil, pull my hair back in the same way each time I sat down to draw. Eventually I hit my stride and was able to dip in and out of flow. Since then, I’ve strived for my flow state whether I’m coding, reading or drawing. </p>
<p>This morning I opted for a figure drawing exercise and listened to a 7 year old playlist in an attempt to recapture that first feeling of flow. I will continue to work toward that utter lack of self-judgement. </p>

    <p>Above is a one-line drawing exercise depicting different items on my desk: the base of a lamp, a stack of books, and my sewing machine.</p>

    <p>Today I also put some more touches on a jellyfish drawing that I began over the summer. My goal was to emphasize the fishbowl, as round pieces of glass are extremely challenging to communicate well. It's a work in progress...</p>
