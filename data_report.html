          <p> Project Gutenberg is an online library of books whose U.S. copyright has expired. I conducted a word frequency and
              sentiment analysis on the fiction for which plain text files are available in the library. Note that the analysis,
              along with its results are detailed below. Though Gutenberg does not provide the original
              publish date of books in their metadata, they do provide the author birth and death year. To gain an understanding
              of the factors of the analysis over time, birth year was used to order the books in a chronological manor. Figure 1
              shows the books used in the analysis, organized by author birth year. Note that if you hover over elements in the
              graph, annotations will appear. </p>

          <p>When conducting the analysis, I looped over each pertinent entry in the Gutenberg catalog, which can be found
             <a class="in-text" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html">here</a>. I constructed two possible
             urls for the book's plaintext version on the Gutenberg website. I queried the url, scraped all text from the page,
             stripped the headers, and conducted the analysis. Of the 8362 books in my original set, I was able to successfully
             complete the analysis for each.</p>

          <p>In order to gain a better understanding of the presence of female vs. male characters in the books, I conducted two
             sets of words: female-specific nouns and male-specific nouns. During the analysis, I identified all sentences
             containing one or more of the "female-specific" nouns as a "female" sentence. I did the same with the male word set.
             I returned the number of "female" sentences divided by the number of total sentences as a female frequency value,
             abbreviated in the resulting dataset as "f_freq". I repeated for the "male" sentences, returning "m_freq". Mostly,
             the results were unsurprising. </p>
