    <p>The below works are taken from my 2022 Master's thesis, <i>Humanizing Computational Literature Analysis Through Art-Based Visualizations</i>
      in which I completed a computational analysis of 15,000 fictional works taken from Project Gutenberg.
      The analysis was aimed at identifying how and how often males versus females are characterized.
      In an effort to humanize the results of what sometimes feel like a cold, analytical method of analysis,
      I chose to translate the findings into an art portfolio that includes computational art as well as
      pure studio art pieces. Not only do the works intend to bring the viewer closer to such impactful
      findings, but art-making process served as a therapeutic venture that allowed for me to fully unpack and understand the implications
      of the computational literary analysis.

    <h3>Shift</h3>
    <p>The <i>Shift</i> visualizations were named for there abilitiy to show the shifting of gender representation
    throughout a single book. They were created by dividing a book into three equal parts, meant to symbolically
    represent the three parts of the classical story arc. Sentences within each respective third
    that contained one or more of a predetermined gender-specific word were tagged as either female, male or both.
    In each row of the diagram 1,000 dots were generated. The percentage of gendered sentences that were labelled female
    determined the number of dots that were placed in the right rectangle. Conversely, the percentage of male sentences
    dictated the number of dots on the left.

    <h3>X Visualizations</h3>
    <p>While the <i>Shift</i> diagrams were successful in visualizing the gender representation in a
       single work, they lack the ability to convey this information for several books at the same
       time. The X visualizations were reimagined to fill this gap. Each X consists of
       a line beginning at the lower left and ending at the upper right representing the female
       representation and a line beginning at the upper right and ending at the lower left representing
       the male representation in a single work. The segments are each divided into thirds which,
       moving from the left to right, represent the beginning, middle and end of the fictional piece.
       The width of the individual thirds of each segment are proportional to the percentage of total
       gendered sentences that are labelled with the respective gender within the corresponding division
       of the book. The X diagram below visualizes the hundred most downloaded ebooks from Project Gutenberg
       in the week of October 3, 2022.
