    <p>The first I heard the word "flow" in reference to work, was not from a coder, but rather from an art teacher. The benefit of being a perfectionist (read: slow) in art class, was that I spent a lot of time after class in the art room absorbing conversations of the older kids with our teacher. She described flow in drawing as having pushed past the point of self-judgement. The only thing that exists in your mind is your subject and the need to put it on paper.</p>
    <p>During that time, we were covering figure drawing in class. I began obsessively listening to the same set of songs, use the same pencil, pull my hair back in the same way each time I sat down to draw. Eventually I hit my stride and was able to dip in and out of flow. Since then, I’ve strived for my flow state whether I’m coding, reading or drawing. </p>
    <p>This morning I opted for a figure drawing exercise and listened to a 7 year old playlist in an attempt to recapture that first feeling of flow. I will continue to work toward that utter lack of self-judgement. </p>

    <p>Above is a one-line drawing exercise depicting different items on my desk: the base of a lamp, a stack of books, and my sewing machine.</p>

    <p>Today I also put some more touches on a color pencil jellyfish drawing that I began over the summer. My goal was to emphasize the fishbowl, as round pieces of glass are extremely challenging to communicate well. It's a work in progress...</p>

    <p>This morning while on our weekly update call, I mentioned to Scott that I was planning to make a drawing of a jellyfish inside of a lava lamp rather than a fishbowl (above). This sparked Scott's imagination and he suggested that I create a lava lamp simulation to use as a form of data visualization. Inspired by this conversation, I created the below lava lamp simulation in Processing as my daily sketch. </p>
    <div class="centered" id="lavalamp1"></div>
    <p>The simulation is a prototype for something a bit more sophisticated. Currently, the sketch consists of 4 "leader" and 8 "follower" ellipses traveling through a vector field. The vector field is re-generated every so often so that the ellipses don't fall into a pattern. The "followers" also change leaders every so often to simulate the bits of lava that break off of larger pieces in an actual lava lamp. </p>
    <p>Some ideas for improving the sketch are to dive into the pixel-level to create more organic-looking shapes around the ellipses, while still using the ellipses as the drivers of movement. I also would consider transitioning into WebGL 3D to add lighting and the z-dimension. I could potentially capture the bottom-lighting and glow of a lava lamp.  </p>
    <p>If worked into a higher-quality version, the lava lamp could be used as a data visualization tool. Though I'm unsure of how I would make that happen yet, I'd love to explore the idea of a multi-colored lava lamp. Traditionally this effect is created by adding different colored lighting at the top and bottom of the lamp. However, because this is a simulation, it may be interesting to explore this theme without the inherent limitations of physical matter. </p>

    <p>These two figure drawings are an excerpt from a 30 minute gesture drawing exercise through <a href="https://line-of-action.com/">Line of Action</a>. In the exercise, you are given 7 reference images, with 30 seconds to complete each. Then you are given 5 more images with a minute to complete each. Finally, you are given 2 images with 5 minutes each. The above are the 5 minute drawings.</p>
    <p>Though I’ve completed the exercise several times throughout the week, my drawings haven’t improved much. However, I’m slowly getting more comfortable with a pencil again. </p>
    <img class="sketch" src="./images/sketch-12-2-2.jpg" alt="Collage Elements">
    <p>Since getting a puppy, my <i>New Yorker</i> subscription has been neglected. In an attempt to somehow utilize the magazines stacked in my mail box, I cut out some images to add to my growing collection of collage materials. I also got some use out of a new X-Acto knife to make some interesting cut outs. These will eventually go to a good cause...when inspiration strikes.</p>
    <img class="sketch" src="./images/modern-quilt.jpg" alt="Modern Quilt">
    <p>While having cheap sushi for lunch the other day, I caught some snippets of the PBS sewing channel. The most intriguing concept caught my eye: modern quilting. Immediately my mind was racing. Like most everyone else my age, my apartment is done up in “modern” fashion and my wardrobe is ever approaching “minimalism”. Even my tattoos are simple line drawings. Who would be better to approach such a twist on an old craft.<p>
    <p>**I hope my slight sarcasm and hint of self-deprecation are coming across here**</p>
    <p>But seriously, I can sew. I can put color blocks together in a way that looks artsy and sleek. Can I get a computer to do that in such a way that communicates the results of a data analysis? I have confidence that I can.</p>
    <p>Next steps include figuring out how using machine learning to create images actually works. If I can figure that out, I will generate several quilt patterns. Because creating a quilt can be extremely time-consuming I could buy the material and make a few. Then, I could display the unused patterns as part of the “exhibit”.</p>
    <p>The idea plays a bit on the idea of female artists taking back stereotypically female crafts such as cross-stitch or crochet. Ah the possible levels of irony and metaphor.</p>

    <p>Today's sketch is an expriment I created in P5.js based on the Chaikin Curve Algorithm, which smooths a curve by iteratively replacing every point by two new points: one 1/4 of the way to the next point and one 1/4 of the way to the previous point. I replaced this 1/4 ratio with 0.1 and showed each step of the iterative algorithm. When clicked, the points of the original line are regenerated, resulting in a new image each time.</p>
    <div class="centered" id="sketch_12_3_2"></div>
    <p>UPDATE: After walking away from the former sketch for several hours, I realized that the results, though visually appealing, didn't make much sense. I realized that I forgot to include about half of the algorithm. These results make much more sense along the lines of the formerly explained Chaikin Algorithm. One can clearly see a much smoother curve result. I maintain, however, that the prerveious sketch was a happy little accident whose concepts I'll likely use later. </p>
